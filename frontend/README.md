#### Playbook
The playbook tells you, according to your data, how much you have left every frequency f (months, bi-weekly, etc.) after bills are paid and payday deposited.
Once you understand that, you can more wisely spend or save your money depending on your goals.
How much money would I have if all expenses were 0? Over a given date range?
What do my total expenses add up to in a year?
After paydays and bills, if I want to save for a down payment of $s in z years, how many times x can I go out and spend an average of y dollars?
